# What this site is
At first I used my site as a portfolio. It required me to introspect about ~~artist~~ identity, voice, and themes. Although I still introspect about these things, it is not for my *own* sake and not the sake of a theoretical employer. My art is not content designed to turn a profit for advertisers looking to capitalize on my output. Rather, it is expression for its own sake; a hidden gem within the scope of the internet; a word of mouth spread without attempt of virality. Simply put it's me.
