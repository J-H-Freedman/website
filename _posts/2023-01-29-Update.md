The website's mini-overhaul is finally done! Here's what I did:
<ul>
<li>
I replaced the difficult to use interface for multi-image pages. I was overthinking and over-designing a simple gallery. Sorry about that...
</li><li>
I am constructing the pages for my Ai generated art. Admittedly, there are a <i>lot</i> of images I'm sorting through, so it'll take some time. If enough people like them, I'll post a large pile of extras including lots of novelty Shreks.
</li><li>
The profile picture is finally updated. I haven't had short hair in years lol.
</li><li>
Lots of little UI tweeks to make it better on phones (hopefully).
</li>
</ul>

Thank you once again for your patience and support <3
