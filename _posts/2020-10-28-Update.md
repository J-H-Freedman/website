<p>Yo it's been a hot minute, hasn't it. So obviously the website has been overhauled as I've been eluding to for the past couple years. It&#39;s been quite a journey to get to this point.</p>

<p>What&#39;s that? It looks almost exactly the same? Well that&#39;s where you&#39;re wrong kiddo:</p>

<ul>
<li>Total conversion- There is not a single line of code for this site that I have not personally written. Reconstructing the site from scratch has been quite a time consuming task but it was worth it. Adobe Muse is a thing of the past and I will never return to it again.</li>
<li>Reactive design- The website is now usable on mobile devices</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Jacob you handsome genius</i>, you must be thinking, <i>is your journey complete? You have a website with art on it! Surely you must be finished!</i> </p>

<p>Pfft. I wish. Despite the site being live, there are still some problems&ndash;surprising, I know. I will fix them as they come up.</p>

<p><i>What about the art stuff? Are you still doing that? It&#39;s been <b>years</b>, my dude&hellip;</i></p>

<p>I&#39;m working on a tabletop role playing game with my close friend, Mike. I will post updates as it progresses. Part of that process will be illustrations and creative writing. I am eager to post those as well.</p>

<p>I hope that was a sufficient update for what&#39;s going on! See ya next time.</p>
