*Deadlock* for friends who don't play MOBAs

# What is *Deadlock*?
Simply put, it's *DotA 2* that tricks you into thinking it's *Overwatch*. 

To reiterate, this is a MOBA, **not** a hero shooter. That's a good thing

# How the fuck do I play a MOBA
I'll tell you once I know lol. Really though, here are some  quick fundamentals that carry over from DotA 2 to get you started:

## Early game
Two goals:
1. Stay alive
2. Get XP

You do this by utilizing minions and towers

### Minions
Yo, see those little guys? They duke it out with each other on equal ground. If there is no player involvement, they'll be at a stalemate. By extension if you damage or kill one, let alone the whole wave, your minions will be at an advantage until things even out again. They prioritize attacking you if you are closer to them than your minions so stay behind yours when you can. They're nothing to be afraid of per say but right now, you can't afford to dive.

#### Experience
The only way to get experience off minions is to "last hit" them. No kill assist is rewarded if your minion delivers the killing blow.[^1] 

[^1]: in the days of yore, this was very fucking annoying due to slow attack speeds and low damage. Thankfully in this game you have a machine gun.

You *can* empty your mag into them if you want, but due to the vulnerability of long reload times, a common strategy is to focus more on picking off injured ones and taking pot shots at other Characters trying to do the same.

Also, in this game there are floating XP bubbles. Shoot these when you can

### Enemy Heroes
Just harass them. Because the early game goal is to accumulate your XP, the secondary goal is denying their XP. Bullying them out of farming your minions and/or getting them to focus more on you than farming is how it's done. Outside of your basic attack, most Hero's "1" ability is good for basic harassment. Knowing when to chase and secure a kill will come with experience.

### Towers
Very fucking terrifying. Right now these are even scarier than other players due to high health and high damage. Right now, use your minions to chip away at it. Do **not** chase enemy Characters through that point. 

### Fuck, I'm dying
Get behind your minions and by extension, don't hesitate to pull back to your tower if your cheeks are getting slapped. You might still be able to stay in the skirmish by taking pot shots from safety

But if your health is at a sliver, just head back to base. It's always better than being killed. But before heading back to base, if reasonable, try to clear enemy minions if they made it to your tower.

### Items
Fuck it. Download a guide and click things from left to right

### When to go back to base
1. When you're close to death, heal up
2. It just feels like you have a bunch of cash, you farmed minions to their tower and they're MIA
	* After killing their character, you'll usually have enough cash and time

## Mid game
