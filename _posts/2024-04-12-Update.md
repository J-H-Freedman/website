Welcome to 2024. Been a while, friend. So here's an update on some changes:
* New [About](../about.html) edit dropped. Basically saying I'm burned out on sad stuff and the art I used to make. Trying to be more lighthearted with my art
* Theater fixed
  * Finally uploaded to Youtube. I don't really know why it took this long to be honest. But I just looked at Vimeo today and thought, *why the fuck am I still here?* So there we go.
  * Aspect ratio fixed on [***Another Man's Treasure***](/../theater/another-mans-treasure.html). For some reason it was in 16:9 instead of 4:3 with black bars on the side. It's embarrassing how lazy I ~~am~~ was.

So you might be asking what I've been up to. And if not, I'll tell you anyway. I'm taking a break from more serious unpublished projects such as ***The Hive's Labyrinth*** and ***Tower of Flesh and Bone*** in favor of more structured writing and lighthearted comics. Here's what's currently in the works:
* Structured writing
  * ***A Love Letter to Riichi***: *Chess, Poker, Gambling, and the Power of Media*
  * ***On Ai Art 2***: *Embracing Sludge and Revisiting Dada*
* Comic
  * ***Tunnels of Moonkrall***

I'm pretty excited! Although I'm spending ~~way too much~~ time with Baldur's Gate 3, I'm pretty confident I'll crack at it sooner than later ;)
