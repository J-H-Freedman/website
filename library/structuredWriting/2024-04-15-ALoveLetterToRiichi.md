# Chess

One of my formative memories is playing chess with my dad. I don't really remember a time when I didn't know what the pieces did. Maybe castling and [en passant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/En_passant) but the rest of what I learned is common patterns and theory-- e.g. forks, pins, and skewers[^1]. Then there were patterns I learned, particularly in the end game in which the game when the pieces remaining have specific traps, escapes, and stalemates. I never really studied any of them other than the scenario when there's only one pawn left.

My favorite part was, and still is, the middle game. That's where the cleverness really kicked in for me and where my progression was the most visible. Stacking pins came the most natural as a kid and I eventually learned to use the stack as a diversion to capitalize on weakened positioning even if the exchange itself is unfavorable. It's like knocking dominoes over until a bowling ball comes out of nowhere and wrecks the pattern.


To enhance my strengths, my dad taught me the only opening I have ever used: King's Indian Defense. It is an opening that lets the opponent occupy the coveted center of the board in favor controlling those spaces from the flank. It is flexible, reactive, and sneaky. I would often wind up in the SÃ¤misch or Averbakh variations without knowing it. It placed me in satisfying tournament ranks.




... but I eventually stopped. And then my dad did too. I wondered why for a long time. He then complained to me about how he was at the level in which his opponents memorized hundred year old games played by central and eastern Europeans. I guess I had that to a lesser extent with feeling like I had to memorize openings and the responses to openings and so on. This new stack of opening adaptation until mid-game just sounded kind of boring. It gives the illusion I need to study the correct answers or I'll lose. I wonder to what extent my dad was feeling the same way.

/** (at end?) */
Originally this is where the *Chess* section was going to end. But now, while typing this, I see how this dichotomy was a distraction. While typing this, I realize that I should really only to study one subsection of openings, King's Indian variations and where that naturally leads me. While doing research on writing this section, I found that it's from a school of chess called *hypermodernism*. Honestly that was the same moment I found out that there were different schools of thought at all. I then found the book *My System*, by Aron Nimzowitsch which seems to discuss the very thing I'm interested in-- the pseudo-improvisational mindset.

Today I asked Marketplace Books to order *My System* for ~~me and~~ my dad to read through. Maybe it will revitalize our interest.

# Riichi Mahjong

I'm not going to pretend it's anything else; I got into Riichi mahjong because I wanted to read and understand *Akagi* by {Mr. Mangaka}. It is a brilliantly well written suspense thriller that uses high stakes gambling as its paintbrush. It's a direct contrast to his other series *Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor*, a story about using the power of camaraderie to survive the cruelty of capitalism... using high stakes gambling as its paintbrush. Now, in contrast to a cast of Kaiji and his gambling addict friends who always lose, we have a kid who will *always* win to the point that it dips into horror. So instead of the suspense of whether or not Kaiji and his comrades' plans will pay off-- will he keep his fingers?; we have the dramatic irony behind the fate of Akagi's opponent and sadism of causing hope drain from their eyes.

There's only one problem: Riichi mahjong is complicated. Of all the tabletop games I've played, I've never seen a game with this high of a skill floor. I had no idea what was going on-- no idea why things were good or bad or surprising. Coming in fresh, Riichi is a really complicated game that makes no sense. Even after spending a good hour reading the rules and tutorials, the jargon was a *huge* barrier. Maybe it would be readable with tooltips full of translator notes. MangaFire can only do so much. Shame.

So the only thing left to do is ~~put the book down and do something else. It's not worth it to~~ learn the rules deep enough to complete *Akagi* at peak enjoyment. At first, I chose an offline Riichi game for my phone, [Kemono Mahjong](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1508430/Kemono_Mahjong/). I liked it for its good offline AI and abundence of settings to help me develop. Being offline meant there was no pressure for me to hurry up and allows for helpful tools. It was rough! I didn't know why my hands wouldn't work; I didn't know when they did; I didn't know when Honor tiles were useful
