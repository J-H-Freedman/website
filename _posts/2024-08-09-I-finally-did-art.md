For the first time in eight (8) years, I made art I'm honestly proud of. I found a way to use the medium I'm most comfortable with in a creative process that happens to work for me ~~so far~~. The hardest barrier to get over is accepting that it's short form.

All I have to is put marks on the paper and not stop moving my hand until the drawing comes to *me*. The marks beget textures. Through the textures, the piece takes form. Now I just develop and finish it. It normally takes a couple hours-- no more than a day ~~so far~~.

Yet I keep thinking of <a href="theater/another-mans-treasure.html">Another Man's Treasure</a> (to be retitled to *Drink*)-- how I perceive it as my art's highest point, despite having to cut half of it. I keep thinking, *maybe one day I'll finish it*. Although I'm open to the idea, realistically it's just a romantic symbol of my past that exemplifies how much I struggle with creating long form content in general. After all, if a ream can't crack two minutes, how could I expect myself to make ninety.
I've come to accept that this false dilemma that only exists within the framework of specific algorithmic rewards and/or monetary compensation. I don't need to write the Great American Novel<sup>TM</sup> when I often express myself in flash fiction; I don't need to make a graphic novel when 'zines have sufficed ~~so far~~; I don't need to develop an art style that isn't mine to spend 40+ hours on a drawing I'll never find good enough.I am beginning to trust who I am and to do art for myself, no one else. Let's see how far it goes...
