content_description: With two years sunk between my first post and now, a lot has changed. Ai is dead. The community is to blame.

With my website attached to my email, I need to take what I post here more seriously. Whether I like it or not this *is* being looked at by employers and the like so I need to take this more seriously, particularly my out of date writing.

In this case, AI and the culture around it has changed so completely that I fully disavow them my <a href="/library/structuredWriting/On-Ai-Art.html">original writing</a>. I still am proud of what I produced from it, but outside of the Ai  community [and other intellectually honest artists] that understand and utilize the soulless element of the tool instead of denying it, the most vocal proponents of AI have evolved to be explicitly anti-art and even anti-artist. I was lied to by someone I trusted and we are on no speaking terms.

Unfortunately this is no longer a question of how to use it in a fine art scenario but rather a political issue about Ai being used as a "business solution." This makes me sad. It makes me angry. Above all, it makes me disappointed. Anti-intellectualism is determined to kill the idea of art itself in favor of empty "content."

I plan on going deeper into analyzing handcrafted media, from the sincere honesty of outsider art to the cynically demanded flatness of corporate art. The status of Ai just makes me too sad to deconstruct further. Hopefully I'll never discuss it again outside of the limited series I produced.
