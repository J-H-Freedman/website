                    I hit an art slump that persisted for literal years. My refuge out was playing with an AI art generator and seeing my visions come to life for the first time since "pages" from 2016.
                    In 2022 I was shown Dreamup.ai and started playing with prompts to create images of the world I was creating. My first prompt was "A Tower of Flesh and Bone," the title of my stories.

                <p>Yo it&#39;s been a hot minute, hasn&#39;t it. So obviously the website has been overhauled as I&#39;ve been eluding to for the past couple years. It&#39;s been quite a journey to get to this point.</p>

                <p>What&#39;s that? It looks almost exactly the same? Well that&#39;s where you&#39;re wrong kiddo:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Total conversion- There is not a single line of code for this site that I have not personally written. Reconstructing the site from scratch has been quite a time consuming task but it was worth it. Adobe Muse is a thing of the past and I will never return to it again.</li>
                    <li>Reactive design- The website is now usable on mobile devices</li>
                </ul>

                <p><i>Jacob you handsome genius</i>, you must be thinking, <i>is your journey complete? You have a website with art on it! Surely you must be finished!</i> </p>

                <p>Pfft. I wish. Despite the site being live, there are still some problems&ndash;surprising, I know. I will fix them as they come up.</p>

                <p><i>What about the art stuff? Are you still doing that? It&#39;s been <b>years</b>, my dude&hellip;</i></p>

                <p>I&#39;m working on a tabletop role playing game with my close friend, Mike. I will post updates as it progresses. Part of that process will be illustrations and creative writing. I am eager to post those as well.</p>

                <p>I hope that was a sufficient update for what&#39;s going on! See ya next time.</p>
