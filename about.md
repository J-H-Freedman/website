I'm a writer and multimedia artist with a background in animation, but over the years it stopped being that simple. I started programming a bit before 2020 and am currently pursuing data science. With this industry shift, I'm currently reassessing what it means to be "an artist." As much as I love producing grit and horror, it has finally worn me down. So I'm taking a step back to create what I actually *want* to make, not what I feel like I should. I need to discover loving art again.

My most well known works are [***Another Man's Treasure***](theater/another-mans-treasure.html) and [***pages***](gallery/pages.html). However, my favorite things to make have been my unpublished comics: ***Hamball***, ***Bull & Winkle @ Law***, and ***The Donut Factory***.
