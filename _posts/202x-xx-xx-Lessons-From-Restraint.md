Unfortunately I find myself back on Facebook and social media in general. I'm very thankful to myself that I took the break I needed and recommend it to literally everyone. Here's what I learned from touching grass:


# Social media is only to be used for two things:
## 1. Friends & family
That's why we're all here, right? To message relatives and long-lost friends who's phone numbers I lost for 10+ years; to share things we find funny to people we don't normally talk to;  

## 2. Art


# Social media is not to be used for self-radicalization
## Avoid Black Pill<sup>TM</sup> content as if it will literally kill me [because it actually might]
## ***Never*** engage with a comment section, unless it's positive
## I am under no obligation to be up to date on every piece of news nor care about every injustice in the world
Most people are normal
