J.H. Freedman is a multimedia artist with a background in animation. Throughout the mediums they work in, there is a dark atmosphere with a comic undertone. They see the horror of occupying meat powered by bio-chemicals and find absurdity societal structures they are forced to participate in.

They utilize the surrealism and horror in their art as tools to explore sociopolitical situations and the characters that would arise from them.
