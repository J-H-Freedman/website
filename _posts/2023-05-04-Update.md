layout: post-writing

I'm no longer using my site as a portfolio to be used for the sake of employment or commission work. The art industries have been nothing but huge letdowns (other than game design, interestingly enough). So now this site, the one that carries my name, will be treated as something just for me. Sometimes it feels as if I'm talking to myself on here, but that's okay. I prefer it to the deafening silence from clients I would inevitably dissapoint.

Anyway, I noticed I started writing more lately. Prose seem to flow more naturally to me than digital brush strokes. Probably because it's the only art form I've done that hasn't yet been commodified. As things come out, the library will expand further.

Which brings me to the obvious structure change: "Updates" became the "Library." These may act like an update log or as structured writing, depending on how spicy I get. I just know that I am a lot more free to write whatever I want with these changes. Let's see what happens next...
