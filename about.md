I'm a writer and multimedia artist with a background in animation, but over the years it stopped being that simple. I started programming a bit after 2020 and am currently pursuing data science. Honestly, I don't create much anymore and am currently reassessing what it means to be "an artist."

I used to create a lot of grit and horror, but it has finally worn me down. What was my escape turned into a prison. So I'm taking a step back to discover what I actually *want* to make-- what I want to say. 

So what to talk about in this site's "About Me" is a weird thing to think about. Until I have an answer, the site will have to speak for my self.
