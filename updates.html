                    The 2020s are turning out to be harder than I thought they ever could be. I needed a break for just moment. But then all at once I experienced an ego death. Soon after I came out to myself as a queer bisexual and began using entheogens.
                    </p><p>It's now hip to say, "time isn't real," but lately it hit home. Over the past couple years, I was experiencing something resembling being a teenager all over again; but instead of learning to navigate the world of girls, it was navigating the world of boys. Even worse was the question, "bi man or bi woman?" I found that the question itself was a false dichotomy and unfair to even ask.
                    </p><p>So now the question is, "How can I capture this through my art?" Well it's kind of weird isn't it; no longer recognizing myself in the mirror. For a while, it was like looking at a twin brother: a hairy, sloppy, masculine dwarf; handsome though. The medication made me very aware of my brain chemicals and the fact that they were being manipulated. The entheogens were making my aware of my skin, my muscles, and my electric flow. I could feel everything while understanding that I am, in some ways, a slave to the chemicals that allow me to be "me." I needed to express that. I <i>needed</i> it.
                    </p><p><i>A Tower of Flesh and Bone</i> began its outline process. The story of what it means to become meat was needling my brain. I needed to know what it looked like. I know it's a touchy subject for a lot of people, but I found that my favorite tool for the job has been AI generated rendering tools. Utilizing prose as the prompts have generated results that I literally could not imagine: the hive and its surreal complexity; the Blood Fields and its meaty masses spurting up from the soil's veins; and, of course, the Tower of Flesh and Bone with its mysterious presence amidst it all.
                    </p><p>Now I do plan on inking over these images and treating them like references; but I do not want that to delegitimize how powerful this tool has been to help me visualize this world. Every generated batch teaches me about this place and I cannot wait to discover the stories that come from it during my writing process. In fact, I would argue that it is all inseparable as one influences the other in a self-feeding loop.
                    </p><p>I'm very excited.

                <p>Yo it&#39;s been a hot minute, hasn&#39;t it. So obviously the website has been overhauled as I&#39;ve been eluding to for the past couple years. It&#39;s been quite a journey to get to this point.</p>

                <p>What&#39;s that? It looks almost exactly the same? Well that&#39;s where you&#39;re wrong kiddo:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Total conversion- There is not a single line of code for this site that I have not personally written. Reconstructing the site from scratch has been quite a time consuming task but it was worth it. Adobe Muse is a thing of the past and I will never return to it again.</li>
                    <li>Reactive design- The website is now usable on mobile devices</li>
                </ul>

                <p><i>Jacob you handsome genius</i>, you must be thinking, <i>is your journey complete? You have a website with art on it! Surely you must be finished!</i> </p>

                <p>Pfft. I wish. Despite the site being live, there are still some problems&ndash;surprising, I know. I will fix them as they come up.</p>

                <p><i>What about the art stuff? Are you still doing that? It&#39;s been <b>years</b>, my dude&hellip;</i></p>

                <p>I&#39;m working on a tabletop role playing game with my close friend, Mike. I will post updates as it progresses. Part of that process will be illustrations and creative writing. I am eager to post those as well.</p>

                <p>I hope that was a sufficient update for what&#39;s going on! See ya next time.</p>
