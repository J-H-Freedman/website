content_description: The Blood Fields is our escape-- sprawling veins that connect its life; the stem cell mines and bio-chemical pools which free us from the mechs we're born into and return us to becoming meat; the abandoned infrastructure of those who came before us shows us that we we once existed independent of the Hive, free of its oppression. Life here isn't utopian, but at least we feel alive.
