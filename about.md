I'm a multimedia artist from Troy, NY who primarily creates expressionist compositions and animation using charcoal & pastels.

This site acts as a collection of my pieces from drawings to animations to writings. I add stuff consistently but not frequently, so I encourage you to check in every couple weeks ~~or months~~ to check for [updates](/library/updates.html).

Although I do not do commissions, I still encourage [reaching out](mailto:jacob@jhfreedman.com) if you're so inclined. I don't bite.
