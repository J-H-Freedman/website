I'm a writer and multimedia artist with a background in animation. But over the years it stopped being that simple. I started programming a bit after 2020 which has snowballed into a profession shift. Ironically this has given me more time to write and draw since college. 

In early 2023, I got into Ai generated art and found my niche in disturbing images using made-up words and embracing the medium's sludge. I dipped my toes in the Ai horror scene which I might revisit. 

I'm currently writing several structured writing pieces as I search for my next 'big project.'
