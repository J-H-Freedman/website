A lot has changed this year. I refuse to talk about the daily existential crisis that compounds in a recursive nightmare day by day. We all know. We don't need more. We don't need more black pill content. So I'll focus on myself for now:

Since my last post I have gotten a CompTIA Data+ certification; updated my takes on Ai; continued a couple projects; and started a few more, including deeper analysis into media and design. I was writing a long paper, *Fascist Rhetoric: When Feelings Don't Care About Facts and Empathy is Controversial*, but I am shelfing it until it is no longer a detriment to my mental health.

I look forward in sharing progress on my little projects in the near future. I have a bunch of drawings of little guy on sticky notes that I want to carve into stamps-- a cute little escape. :)
