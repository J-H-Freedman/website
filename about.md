I'm a multimedia artist from Troy, NY who primarily creates expressionist compositions and animation using charcoal & pastels. Lately I have begun writing more seriously and have a handful of articles in the works.   

This site acts as a collection of my pieces from drawings to animations to writings. I add stuff consistently but not frequently, so I encourage you to check in every couple weeks ~~or months~~ to check for [updates](/library/updates.html).
