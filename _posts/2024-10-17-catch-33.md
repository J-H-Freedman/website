Lately, I've begun revisiting my old music to see what holds up. Since around my mid-20s I have been disillusioned with the metal scene. There was an inescapable interconnection of the increasingly toxic culture, the genre being pushed to the fringes, and general stagnation. Also, *I* changed. I was tired of the machismo posturing and wanted to relax; so my tastes evolved into post-rock, chillout, and general down-tempo. Honestly what put the nail in the coffin was Vaporwave, a fresh [at the time] noise inspired genre that scratched many of my tastes simultaneously. 

I could easily talk about the stuff that is *very* out of date and should remain in the past (RIP Children of Bodom), but I instead want to revisit something that became one of my top albums of all time: *Catch 33* by Meshuggah.

When I was in secondary school I saw their music video for *[Shed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjzIBI3jkKY&t=1s)* on Fuse TV (RIP) and became enamored by it. But when I bought the the album it's from, I simply wasn't ready for what it was due to me literal immature tastes. It was slow; it didn't go "heavy"; there was barely any lyrics; I'd blink and would be at track 4 thinking it was still track 1. At first I thought I got scammed, but I also alsoknew I stumbled upon something... interesting? I simply had no idea what it even was. So I shelved it.

But it stuck in my brain like tar. I never heard anything like it before. Later I would discover *Tool* which was the closest thing I had to the familiar "interesting" feeling. Over the years, I would revisit the album and appreciate it more little by little. In college I'd call it one of my favorite albums of all time, but I still didn't *get it*.

Now I'm in my 30s and have matured as an artist, a writer, and as a person; now ready to take an honest look without judgement. Today I pulled up [the playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MluSij-Kfts&list=PLHTo__bpnlYWGvrREEUNuVxuum9NyWJO1 "Catch 33 album") and for the first time listened while reading [the lyrics](https://www.meshuggah.net/catchthirtythreelyrics "Catch 33 lyrics"). It finally clicked. I get it. I finally get it. It's beautiful.
