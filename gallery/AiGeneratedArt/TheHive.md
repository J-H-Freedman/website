content_description: The hive is death through stagnation. It exists only to fuel itself; a rube Goldberg machine of seemingly infinite recursion. We don't know why we're here, why we were created, nor for what end. No one knows the full extent of the bureaucracy; the top of the hierarchy; the heart of the machine. And honestly, we don't want to find out.
