# Free full quality PNGs
I post all of my full quality PNG files here. Due to their infinite supply, the files are technically worthless. I give permission to download and share them under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/">CC BY-NC-SA</a> license:

# Tip Jar
In good faith, I would appreciate a tip. That way I can create more free stuff at the pace I prefer instead of the one I'm doomed to.
